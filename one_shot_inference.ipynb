        "KemPharm Partners with the Hypersomnia Foundation to Support Sleep Disorder Research and Advocacy January 18, 2023 at 7:30 AM EST KemPharm advancing multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of KP1077 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) CELEBRATION, Fla., Jan. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KemPharm, Inc. (NasdaqGS: KMPH) (KemPharm, or the Company), a rare disease therapeutics company focused on the development of treatments for rare central nervous system (CNS) disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders and related treatment areas, announced its partnership with the Hypersomnia Foundation, which engages, informs and champions the global community to improve the lives of people with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) and related sleep disorders. IH is a chronic neurologic disorder marked by significant detrimental effects on nighttime sleep as well as daytime sleepiness/wakefulness. It is estimated that approximately 37,000 patients are currently diagnosed with IH and seeking treatment, although the total population may be much larger due to patients not seeking treatment or having not been diagnosed. KemPharm is currently investigating KP1077 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, dose-optimizing, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KP1077 for the treatment of IH. KemPharm expects to enroll approximately 48 adult patients with IH in more than 30 centers in the United States. Additional details about the study, how to enroll, and available study sites can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05668754). “We are pleased to be working in coordination with the Hypersomnia Foundation to increase awareness and knowledge of idiopathic hypersomnia for patients, caregivers and clinicians to better understand the condition and advance research, with the ultimate goal of faster diagnosis and improved outcomes,” said Richard W. Pascoe, Chief Executive Officer of KemPharm. “IH is a rare sleep disorder for which few treatment options exist. We believe KP1077 has the potential to address the most debilitating symptoms of IH, and we look forward to advancing the recently initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of KP1077 in IH with support from patient groups, including the Hypersomnia Foundation.” “We are deeply grateful for the work KemPharm is doing to advance treatments for our community at such a time when pharmacological options for people with IH are so desperately lacking,” said Claire Crisp, MFA, Chief Executive officer of the Hypersomnia Foundation. “Support from sponsors like KemPharm are key to our efforts to advocate for and support those dealing with debilitating sleep disorders.”\n",
